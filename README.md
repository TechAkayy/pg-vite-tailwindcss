## Pre-packed

### Framework / Build Tool

Vite is used in watch mode to treeshake, bundle, minify & optimize all ES modules, CSS, and other assets via the entry file `main.js`. The output is generated into the `dist` folder.

The bundled assets inside the dist folder, for example, `/dist/assets/css/output.css` and `/dist/main.js`, can be referenced in the HTML files via script and link tags.

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-lib).

### UI Frameworks

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) - The amazing utility-first CSS framework.
- Wordpress - If using with Tailwind CSS with Wordpress, disable preflight in `tailwind.config.js` to avoid style conflicts. [Read more](https://css-tricks.com/adding-tailwind-css-to-wordpress-themes/)

// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: false,
  },
  // ...
  // rest of the config
}
